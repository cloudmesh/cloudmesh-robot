# ESP8266 Driver Installations.

## Installing ESP8266 USB drivers.

To be safe, it is a good idea to install all three of these drivers prior to using cms on ESP8266.

## Drivers

### CH34x Mac OSX Driver.

Run the following command in terminal

`brew tap mengbo/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver https://github.com/mengbo/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver`

and

`brew cask install wch-ch34x-usb-serial-driver`

Start a new terminal after the driver has finished installing.

### Crimson-Bot USB Driver.

**Click** [here](http://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/Software/Mac_OSX_VCP_Driver.zip) and the zip file for the driver will start downloading. Once finished, unzip and open the zip file. Click on the driver install file contained inside and the driver should start installing. Once the driver has finished installing, make sure to start a new terminal.
