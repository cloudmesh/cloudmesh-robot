# Preface

We are presenting an easy interface to robotics while leveraging a
number of community tools. All programming we document here is mostly
done in python. This also allows us to utilize cloudmesh cmd5 which
provides an easy to use command shell.  Future versions will be able
to be installed via pypi, howevewr, currently we recommend instalation
from source.

We integrated some examples to allow students to explore how to use
two borads. One is based on the esp8266, the other is based on
Raspberry PI 3.

We are actively looking for your contributions so we can integrate them.

## Conventions
$ 
> When showing examples of commands, the $ symbol precedes the actual command. So, the other lines are the output obtained after executing the command. An example invoking the ls command follows:

    $ ls


Commands on the NodeMCU are typically indicated with `>>>` the python
interpreter prompt. Example:

    >>> import os
    >>> os.listdir()

PORTALNAME
> In some examples we refer to your portal name as the PORTALNAME you have on FutureSystems.

USERNAME

> In some examples we refer to your local computers name as USERNAME. Your portal name and your local name may be different.

Menu selections

> Start â€£ Programs

Man page:
