   Tornato

We experience an average of more than 20 tornadoes a year in Indiana,
and the best way to protect yourself should one strike your location is
to be prepared. Knowing the difference between a watch and warning can
help you determine the risks you may face. A tornado "watch" means that
weather conditions have the potential to create a tornado in the area,
while a "warning" means that a tornado has been sighted.

Things you should do
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  When you find out there is a tornado warning for your location, get
   inside a building, get away from exterior walls and windows, and go
   down as far as you can.
-  If you are in a car and a tornado is near, get out of your car and
   get inside a building, or lie in a ditch and protect your head with
   your hands.
-  Instructors will have a weather radio and ensure it has full
   batteries in it.
-  Instructors will take the weather radio with them to where you seek
   shelter to stay updated on the situation.

Things you should NOT do
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Never wait for a siren to be sure if the danger is real; always head
   for shelter as soon as you get an alert from the National Weather
   Service. IU-Notify, or an Instructor or other IU employees.
-  Don’t rely on IU-Notify for weather warnings. Your instructors will
   be paying attention to the weather radio and/or the National Weather
   Service apps on their phones.
-  Don’t leave your shelter until an all clear has been given.
-  Never seek shelter under a bridge; the bridge will act as a funnel
   and strengthen the winds underneath.

Fire

Evacuate if

-  A fire alarm is sounding
-  There is the presence of fire, smoke, or the odor of burning in the
   building
-  If you discover a fire, explosion or smoke in a building, inform your
   instructor who will activate the nearest fire alarm and proceed to
   evacuate, following the evacuation procedures here.

Drills
------

-  Instructors will inform students of the location to meet in a case of
   a Tornado.
-  Instructors will inform students how to leave the building in case of
   a fire and where to meet. Be prepared for a headcount and let an
   isntructor know if one of your classmates is missing.

Workspace Security
------------------

Workplace Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tools and other equipment may be shared with the class. After use they
must be returned to the tools section.

Scissors, Knifes and other Sharp tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Students are not allowed to use scissors, knifes, or other sharp tools
including screwdrivers without supervision. Such tools must not be used
inappropriately. Failure to use them appropriately can result in
expulsion from the camp.

Soldering
~~~~~~~~~

For the robot camp soldering will be conducted by a qualified
instructor.

Knowledge of Electricity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we are using ele tricuty and the devices we may use are expensive no
device may be used in a form so that they are broken on purpose. THe
experiment needs to be understood. If not, read the manuals, work with
the assistnts, and get informed. Do the experimen in theory before
"hacking". THe same is valid with the code.

Robot Car Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Floor
^^^^^^^^^^^

Robots are run on white boards in the middle of the room. You are not
allowed to walk without permission across these boards as they need to
be kept clean for the robots. If you need to pick up a robot please make
sure to have clean shoes. If you do leave marks on the board we may ask
you to clean them up yourself.

Robot Table Frames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before running robots on the table you will get a table frame so that
the robots is prevented to fall off the table.

Robot Tripods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A number of tripods are placed in the room. The tripods have a
positioning sensor mounted on them and moving or touching the tripots
will affect the sensors. The tripods are not to be touched. Failure may
result in expulsion from the camp.

Drone Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drone Tripods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A number of tripods are placed in the room. The tripods have a
positioning sensor mounted on them and moving or touching the tripots
will effect the sensors. The tripods are not to be touched. Failure may
result in expulsion from the camp.

Drone Nets
^^^^^^^^^^

In case drones will be used in the camp, drones must not be flown in the
open areas. Instead they will be positioned behind a net. In case you
experiment with drones on your desk, they must be secured with a fishing
line and you must wear safety goggles. These nets are not climbing nets.
They should also not be used to hang on them. They present a safety
barrier between you and the area where the drones fly. Other than
opening the dedicated entry points to the flying area the nets must not
be touched. Failure to do so may result in expulsion from the lab.

Recreational Recess Activities
------------------------------

indoor and outdoor activities. Camp participants are required to follow
instructions from instructors and avoiding dangerous activities. The
same recess rules as in your school apply. If in doubt, ask.
