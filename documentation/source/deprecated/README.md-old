# ESP8266

When working with a external hardware such as the NodeMCU you will
find a lot of information on the internet about it. It is a bit
difficult at times to assess what you need to program it. You are
exposed to many choices. A NodeMCU typically comes with Lua. However
you have many other choices.  Such choices include multiple
programming languages such as Lua, MicroPython, Arduino/C, Go and
others.

As all of them are slightly different you need to identify which works
best for you. In addition you need to install images, programs and
libraries that support your specific language choice.
 
For our first experiments we will be using MicroPython. This choice is
motivated by the fact that Python is a well established and easy to
learn programming language. Recently many educational institutions are
offering Python as an introductory programming language making this
choice even mor compelling
 
To simplify the setup and use of the esp8266 for MicroPython we
developed an easy to use commandline tool that allows users to set up
their computer and interact more easily with the board. We believe
that the interface is so simple that it can also be used in STEM
activities and not just in the university or by advanced hobbyists.

## Notation

In this document the `$` character at a beginning of a command block
is used to indicate the terminal prompt.  When executing the command
do not copy it.

Commands on the NodeMCU are typically indicated with `>>>` the python
interpreter prompt.

## Setup

First we must install a number of tools on the machine connecting to the board.

### OSX

In our guide we will focus on OSX, however, there should not be any
issues with modifying our installations to work with other operating
systems, such as Linux or even Windows. If you have improvements in
regards to our code, please let us know.

On OSX we will be using homebrew and pyenv to leverage existing
libraries and to allow the use of a user managed Python environment.

#### XCode

OSX provides a number of useful extensions for developers with
*xcode*. Please install it with

	$ xcode-select --install
	
#### Homebrew

Homebrew is a program and package manager that makes it easy to uninstall
precompiled programs on your computer.

To install it you need to open a terminal and run the following command

    $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

#### Install pyenv

Next we install a program called pyenv that will help us managing multiple
versions of python. This is done with the commands

    $ brew update
    $ brew install pyenv pyenv-virtualenv pyenv-virtualenvwrapper
	 
As we later may want to benefit from readline, lest just install it also
	 
	 $ brew install readline xz

#### Install Aquaemacs

You will need an editor to make some modifications to files and write
programs. Certainly you can use `vi` or `emacs`. As we are on OSX we
can also use an editor such as `aquaemacs`. Let us assume you have
installed it on your computer, we recommend to add a shortcut so you
can call it from the commandline. This can be done by editing the
`~/.bash_profile` and add the following to it.

	####################################################################### 
	# PYENV
	######################################################################
	open_emacs() {
    	# open -na Aquamacs $*
    	open -a Aquamacs $*    
	}

	alias emacs=open_emacs

Once done you can start the editor while using the command

	emacs FILENAME
	
where FILENAME is the name of the file you like to edit.


#### Install python 3.6.1

As we want to develop our programs in python we will install it with `pyenv` as follows

    $ pyenv install 3.6.1
    $ pyenv virtualenv 3.6.1 ENV3

To not forget that you are using python 3 and automatically loading it
we simply add it to our `~/.bash_profile` file.

    $ emacs ~/.bash_profile

Add the following lines at the end of the file

    ########################################################
    # PYENV
    ########################################################
    export PYENV_VIRTUALENV_DISABLE_PROMPT=0
    eval "$(pyenv init -)"
    eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

    __pyenv_version_ps1() {
      local ret=$?;
      output=$(pyenv version-name)
      if [[ ! -z $output ]]; then
        echo -n "($output)"
      fi
      return $ret;
    }

    PS1="\$(__pyenv_version_ps1) ${PS1}"

    alias ENV3="pyenv activate ENV3"

    ENV3


The above steps have to be done only once. Now every time you start a
new terminal it will activate ENV3 and with it python 3.6.1.

**Please now close all previously started terminals that do not use
  yet ENV3**

To further improve your python environment you need to make sure *pip*
and *setuptools* are up to date. After you have started a new terminal
window you will by default activate Python 3. To make sure pip and
setup tools are up to date, you can once call

	$ pip install pip -U
	$ pip install setuptools -U

### Installation of the robot Interafce

To more easily interface with the robot we have developed a convenient
program that is installed as part of a command tool called cloudmesh.



#### Install Cloudmesh Robot 

**The install from pip is not yet working**

> To install the robot command you simply type

>	     $ pip install cloudmesh.robot

> This will install a program `cms` on your computer that allows you to
> easily communicate with the robot. 

Developers are however encouraged to work with the source code. Thus
you will need to first obtain it as follows

	$ mkdir github
	$ cd github
	$ git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh.common.git
	$ git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh.cmd5.git
	$ git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh.robot.git
	$ cd cloudmesh.robot
	$ make source

To test out if the command has been
installed please type

    $ cms robot welcome
    
If everything works you should see an ASCII image of R2D2 and
C3PO. Next, we still have to install some additional programs before
you can use other commands. 

The installation of these commands requires administrator access. In
case you are not an administrator you can temporarily change yourself
as an administrator in the OSX configuration windows.  Than you can
execute the command

	$ cms robot osx install
	
In addition you will need to install the OSX driver for the USB
interface to the esp8266. This is achieved with

	$ cms robot osx driver
	
Now please change your account to be again a standard account.
	
Now you **MUST REBOOT** the machine. Without rebooting you will not be
able to use the USB drivers.

Once you have successfully installed the drivers and the commands you
can look at the manual page of the robot command with

    $ cms help robot

You will see a manual page like this::

     Usage:
        robot welcome
        robot osx install
        robot osx driver
        robot image fetch
        robot probe [--format=FORMAT]
        robot flash erase [--dryrun]
        robot flash python [--dryrun]
        robot test
        robot run PROGRAM
        robot credentials set SSID USERNAME PASSWORD
        robot credentials put
        robot credentials list
        robot login
        robot set PORT NOT IMPLEMENTED
        robot ls [PATH]
        robot put [-o] SOURCE [DESTINATION]
        robot get PATH
        robot rm PATH
        robot rmdir PATH
        robot dance FILE IPS
        robot inventory list [--cat] [--path=PATH] [ID]

    Arguments:
        FILE   a file name

    Options:
        -f      specify the file


### Testing the board

Next is to connect a esp8266 with theUSB cable to the computer. After
you connected it, please press the reset button. Before we do anything
else with the board we test it out first. Once you have plugged it in,
you can execute the command

    $ cms robot probe

The output of this command provides you hopefully with a table similar to 
   
    +-----------+---------------------------+
    | Attribute | Value                     |
    +-----------+---------------------------+
    | chipid    | b' 0x00d0f9ec'            |
    | mac       | b' 5c:cf:7f:d0:f9:ec'     |
    | tty       | /dev/tty.wchusbserial1410 |
    +-----------+---------------------------+

Please note that you should only have one board attached to your computer.

### Flashing the image onto the robot board

Next we need to flash the image on the robot board. Naturally we need
to fetch the image first from the internet. We do this with the
command

    $ robot image fetch
    
This will fetch an image that contains MicroPython into your local
directory.

Next we need to *flash* the image on the board. Your board will look
something like this
    
![alt text](images/Official-font-b-DOIT-b-font-ESP-32-ESP-32S-ESP-32-Development-Board-font-b.jpg)
[link with motor shield](https://www.amazon.com/KOOKYE-ESP8266-NodeMcu-ESP-12E-Expansion/dp/B01C6MR62E/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1498599901&sr=8-3&keywords=esp8266++doit)

![alttext](images/feather.png)
[link](https://www.amazon.com/Adafruit-2821-Feather-HUZZAH-ESP8266/dp/B019MGW6N6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1498599868&sr=8-1&keywords=esp8266++feather)

![alttext](images/esp8266-b.png) [link](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Version-NodeMCU-Internet-Development/dp/B010O1G1ES/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1498599733&sr=8-3&keywords=esp8266)

You will need to connect your board to your computer with a USB
cable. The board has a microusb cable adapter.  Make sure to obtain
one as it may not come with the robot.  The board may come with a
preinstalled image such as Lua or some custom image from the
vendor. As we try to program the robot in python let us place
micropython on the board. This requires a number of steps.

#### Erase the chip 

First we need to erase the chip. To follow our instructions place the
chip towards you as shown in the figure. E.g. the USB connector points
to you.

You must allow the chip to be erased by holding both buttons on the
chip and than letting the right button be released first and than the
left button. You will see a blue LED flashing once.  Now you can flash
the chip with the command

    $ cms robot flash erase

#### Putting Python on the chip

To put python on the chip you need to again prepare the board for
flashing while pressing both buttons and releasing the right button
before releasing the left button.

Now ou can place python with the command 

    $ cms robot flash python 
    

#### Testing if it works


To test running a pyton program execute

    $ cms robot test
    
Be careful as it overwrites the file `test.py`.

#### Execute an arbitrary program

Lets assume you have placed a program in the file `prg.py` than you can 
run it with the following command

    $ cms robot run prg.py

#### Interactive Python shell on the board

To get into the interactive python shell on the board you need to make
sure that you have reset the esp8266 once after flashing. You need to
press the reset button.

Than you can use the following command to login

    $ cms robot login
    
    
#### Cleaning an reinstalling a development version

IN case you are a developer and you need to modify the source code, we
found that it is sometimes necessary to clean your development
directory and libraries. The easiest way to do this is to go to the
repository that you like to reinstall. Let us assume it is
*cloudmesh.robot*. Than the following commands will clean the
repository


    $ cd cloudmesh.robot
    $ pip uninstall cloudmesh.robot
    
 Do the pip unisntall as many times till you see an error that no more
 cloudmesh.robot versions can be found. Than execute
 
    $ make clean
    
After this you can reinstall it with 
    
    $ python setup.py install; pip install -e .

the -e flag is optional, but allows you to change the code without the
need of recompiling. A very useful feature in python.

# Tools

## Markdown

Markdown has very good support for editors that render the final
output in a view window next to the editor pane.  Two such editors are

* [Macdown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/): MacDown provides a nice integrated editor that works well.
* [pyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=mac&code=PCC):
  We have successfully used Vladimir Schhneiders
  [Markdown Navigator plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7896-markdown-navigator). Once
  installes you click on a .md file pycharm will automatically ask to
  install the plugins from Markdown for you.

## Emacs on OSX

There are many different versions of emacs available on OSX. Aquaemacs
is often used as it integrates nicely with the OSX GUI interface.

* [AquaEmacs](http://aquamacs.org/download.shtml)

## Matplotlib on OSX

As we typically install python with virtualenv, we need to configure
matplotlib properly to use it. The easiest way to do this is to execute
the following commands. After you run them you can use matplotlib.

	$ pip install numpy
	$ pip install matplotlib
	$ echo "backend : TkAgg" > ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc
